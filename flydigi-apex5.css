/* Flydigi Apex 5 simple GPV skin
   NOTE: This is a basic example CSS for GamePadViewer that places a single background image.
   For perfect alignment and button hitboxes you'd normally use a sliced image + precise positions.
   Save this CSS and the skin.png in the same folder and use the raw file URL as Custom CSS URL in GPV.
